<h1> KLT:  An Implementation of the <br>
Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi Feature Tracker </h1>

KLT is an implementation, in the C programming language, of a feature 
tracker for the computer vision community.
The tracker is based on the early work of Lucas and Kanade [1], was developed fully by
Tomasi
and Kanade [2], and was explained clearly in the paper by
Shi
and Tomasi [3].  
Later, Tomasi proposed a slight modification which
makes the computation symmetric with respect to the two images -- the
resulting equation is  derived
in the unpublished note by myself 
[4].<p>

Briefly, good features are located by examining the minimum
eigenvalue of each 2 by 2 gradient matrix, and features are
tracked using a Newton-Raphson method of minimizing the difference
between the two windows.  
Multiresolution tracking allows for relatively large displacements between images. <p>

The affine computation that evaluates the consistency of features between 
non-consecutive frames [3] was implemented by Thorsten Thormaehlen several years 
after the original code and documentation were written.&nbsp; To use this 
feature, please see the comments and declarations in the source code.<p>
