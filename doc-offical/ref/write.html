KLTWriteFeatureListToPPM() writes the image pointed to by 
<code>greyimg</code> to the PPM file named 
<code>filename</code>.  The features in 
<code>fl</code> are overlayed 
in red.<p>

</code>
</h2>

These functions write feature lists, feature histories, and feature
tables to a file named filename (or to stderr if filename is NULL).
The third parameter, 'fmt', is either:
<ul>
<li> NULL, indicating that a binary file is being created, or
<li> a format string, indicating that a text file is being created.  
The string, which must begin with '%' and end with 'd' or 'f' (e.g.,
"%3d" or "%5.1f"), governs the printing of the feature
locations (the feature values are always printed with "%5d").  
For example, a particular feature
will be written as "(128.2,364.8)= 7634" if 'fmt' is "%5.1f", or as
"(128,365)= 7634" if 'fmt' is "%3d".
</ul>
Binary files are generally preferred since they are smaller and
introduce no truncation error.  However, text files permit easy
viewing off-line.

These functions read feature lists, feature histories, and feature
tables from a file named 'filename' (The file may be either text or
binary).  If the first parameter is NULL, then a structure 
of the same size as that in the file is created, filled, 
and returned. Otherwise, the structure indicated by the first parameter
is filled and returned.  Note that
the structure passed must be the same size as the structure in 
the file (i.e., the nFeatures field must be identical, as well as
the nFrames field).
