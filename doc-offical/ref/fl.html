<h2> KLT_FeatureList </h2> 

<h2> 
<code>
typedef struct  {<br>
     int nFeatures;<br>
     KLT_Feature *feature;<br>
}  *KLT_FeatureList;<br>
</code>
</h2>

A KLT_FeatureList is an array of features.  The 
<code>nFeatures</code> field
indicates the number of features allocated, but not necessarily 
the number of non-lost features.  It must not be changed manually.<p>

NOTE: Although a feature list and a feature history look similar, the former
is intended to refer to an array of features from a single image, while
the latter refers to the same feature tracked through several images.<p>

The following code illustrates how to access the data
in a feature list:

<pre width = 80>
KLT_FeatureList fl;
int feat;

for (feat = 0 ; feat < fl->nFeatures ; feat++)  {
     printf("(%5.1f,%5.1f) = %d\n",
          fl->feature[feat]->x,
          fl->feature[feat]->y,
          fl->feature[feat]->val);
}
</pre>
